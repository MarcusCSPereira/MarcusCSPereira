## üëã Hi there

  I'm Marcus C√©sar, a 19-year-old computer enthusiast who is embarking on the journey of graduating in Computer Science at UESB. I see each challenge as an opportunity to learn and grow, and I am constantly looking to improve my skills, especially in the Java language, which is where I was most interested.
  
  I believe that the academic journey is a unique opportunity to expand horizons, collaborate with brilliant minds and contribute to the advancement of technology. I'm here to discover new things, grow and, above all, learn more every day.

## üöÄ Expertise:

  My main focus is on the backend, where I find my passion for the most analytical part of a system. I love working behind the scenes, organizing data input and output to ensure everything runs smoothly. The logic behind how a system works is what fascinates me, and dedicating my studies to the backend allows me to delve deeply into this aspect.

I believe that backend strength is the foundation for a robust and reliable system.
