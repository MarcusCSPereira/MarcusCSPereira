## üëã Hi there

  I'm Marcus C√©sar, a 19-year-old computer enthusiast who is embarking on the journey of graduating in Computer Science at UESB. I see each challenge as an opportunity to learn and grow, and I am constantly looking to improve my skills, especially in the Java language, which is where I was most interested.
  
  I believe that the academic journey is a unique opportunity to expand horizons, collaborate with brilliant minds and contribute to the advancement of technology. I'm here to discover new things, grow and, above all, learn more every day.

## üöÄ Expertise:

My main focus is currently on mobile application development, particularly for iOS, watchOS, and iPadOS. I am studying Swift and SwiftUI to create seamless and intuitive user experiences. I believe that a solid technical foundation is crucial for building robust and reliable systems.

I enjoy both the idea of creating interactive interfaces and developing what happens behind the scenes of an application. I have a passion for the logic behind how systems work and enjoy organizing data input and output to ensure everything runs smoothly. This analytical mindset, developed through my studies in backend development, enhances my approach to mobile development, allowing me to build efficient and innovative applications.

I believe that the combination of an interactive interface and a solid backend is the key to developing robust and reliable mobile applications.
